## Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary)
- A brief description of your project
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot (SDK) / Kusama
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem? Make sure to at least check the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/), the [wiki's Tech Stack doc](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source) and [OpenGov](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda?status=executed&is_treasury=true).
  - If so, how is your project different? Please identify and assess any projects addressing the same need and explain how your project is distinct. Feel free to include applicable research data, statistics, or metrics.
  - If not, please indicate why such a project might not have been possible, successful, or attempted. 
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected. Below, we provide an **example milestone** with mandatory (0a to 0e) and example deliverables. 

**Please notice that Polkadot Open Source Grants only accept projects up to 3 months of duration and up to 2 milestones.**

### Overview

- **Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 3 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the grant throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD).

> Note that deliverables 0a to 0e are mandatory. Please adapt their specification to your project.
